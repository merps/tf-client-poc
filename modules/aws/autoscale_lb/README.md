# Deploying BIG-IP VEs in AWS - Auto Scale (Active/Active): 1-NIC

## To Do
- EXPIREMENTAL ONLY
- Community support only. Not F5 supported.
- Move to AWS secret manager. Currently passwords are stored in clear text in the runtime init YAML file local to the BIG-IP box.
- Add lifecycle hooks in ASG for auto healing
- Add custom metrics for scale in/out
- Much much much more to do. Not production ready.

## Issues
- Find an issue? Fork, clone, create branch, fix and PR. I'll review and merge into the main branch. Or submit a GitHub issue with all necessary details and logs.

## Introduction

This solution uses a Terraform template to launch a 1-NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE cluster (Active/Active) in Amazon AWS. It uses [AWS Autoscaling Groups (ASG)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html) to allow auto scaling and auto healing of the BIG-IP VE devices. Traffic flows from an AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) to the BIG-IP VE which then processes the traffic to application servers. The BIG-IP VE instance is running with one interface shared by management and data. NIC0 is associated with the external network and used in ASGs.

This solution leverages more traditional Auto Scale configuration management practices where each instance is created with an identical configuration as defined in the Scale Set's "model". Scale Set sizes are no longer restricted to the small limitations of the cluster. The BIG-IP's configuration, now defined in a single convenient YAML or JSON [F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-bigip-runtime-init) configuration file, leverages [F5 Automation Tool Chain](https://www.f5.com/pdf/products/automation-toolchain-overview.pdf) declarations which are easier to author, validate and maintain as code. For instance, if you need to change the configuration on the BIG-IPs in the deployment, you update the instance model by passing a new config file (which references the updated Automation Toolchain declarations) via template's runtimeConfig input parameter. New instances will be deployed with the updated configurations.

## Version
This template is tested and worked in the following versions:
| Name | Version |
| ---- | ------- |
| terraform | ~> 0.14 |
| aws | ~> 3 |


## Prerequisites

- This template requires programmatic API credentials to deploy the Terraform AWS provider and build out all the neccessary AWS objects
  - See the [Terraform "AWS Provider"](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication) for details
  - You will require at minimum `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - ***Note***: Make sure to [practice least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)
- This templates deploys into an *EXISTING* networking stack. You are required to have an existing VPC network and subnets
  - A NAT gateway is also required for outbound Internet traffic
  - If you require a new network first, see the [Infrastructure Only folder](../Infrastructure-only) to get started


## Important Configuration Notes

- Variables are configured in variables.tf
- Sensitive variables like AWS SSH keys are configured in terraform.tfvars or AWS Secrets Manager
- Files
  - main.tf - resources for provider, versions
  - bigip.tf - resources for BIG-IP autoscaling group, launch template, security groups
  - nlb.tf - resources for AWS NLB
  - f5_onboard.tmpl - onboarding script which is run by user-data. This script is responsible for downloading the neccessary F5 Automation Toolchain RPM files, installing them, and then executing the onboarding REST calls.

## BIG-IQ License Manager
This template uses PayGo BIG-IP image for the deployment (as default). If you would like to use BYOL/ELA/Subscription licenses from [BIG-IQ License Manager (LM)](https://devcentral.f5.com/s/articles/managing-big-ip-licensing-with-big-iq-31944), then these following steps are needed:
1. In the "variables.tf", modify *f5_ami_search_name* value with a BYOL filter in the name. Example below...
  ```
          # BIGIP Image
          variable "f5_ami_search_name" { default = "F5 BIGIP-15.1.2.1* BYOL-All* 2Boot*" }
  ```
2. In the "variables.tf", modify the BIG-IQ license section to match your environment
3. In the "f5_onboard.tmpl", add the "myLicense" block under the "Common" declaration ([example here](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation-v2/blob/main/examples/autoscale/bigip-configurations/runtime-init-conf-bigiq.yaml))
  ```
          myLicense:
            class: License
            licenseType: ${bigIqLicenseType}
            bigIqHost: ${bigIqHost}
            bigIqUsername: ${bigIqUsername}
            bigIqPassword: ${bigIqPassword}
            licensePool: ${bigIqLicensePool}
            skuKeyword1: ${bigIqSkuKeyword1}
            skuKeyword2: ${bigIqSkuKeyword2}
            unitOfMeasure: ${bigIqUnitOfMeasure}
            reachable: false
            hypervisor: ${bigIqHypervisor}
            overwrite: true
  ```

## Configuration Example

The following is an example configuration diagram for this solution deployment. In this scenario, all access to the BIG-IP VE cluster (Active/Active) is via a bastion host. The IP addresses in this example may be different in your implementation.
